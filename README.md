House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features using machine learning models. It includes the use of a heatmap for data visualization, and prediction is performed using XGBoost and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about houses, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant factors influencing house prices.

Data Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. Feature selection techniques may also be applied to select the most relevant features for prediction.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An EDA is performed to gain insights into the data. This includes statistical analysis, visualization using histograms and scatter plots, and the use of a heatmap to visualize correlations between features.

Feature Engineering

Feature engineering techniques may be applied to create new features or transform existing features to improve the model's performance.

Model Selection

Two machine learning models are used for prediction:

XGBoost: A gradient boosting algorithm known for its performance and efficiency in handling structured data like the one in this dataset.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): A deep learning model that can capture complex patterns in the data, potentially improving prediction accuracy.

Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess their performance. Cross-validation may also be used to validate the models.

Deployment

The trained models can be deployed using a web application, API, or any other suitable method for making predictions on new data.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models for house price prediction, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in achieving accurate predictions.
